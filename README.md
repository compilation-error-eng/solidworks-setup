# solidworks-setup
2 .bat files to make the setup of SOLIDSQUAD easier because i heard alot of complaints about it run solidworks setup1 first then run 2 
DISCLAIMER!!!
there is a bug in the second batch file u need to copy the contents of folder [your hard drive]:\Solidworks 2021\_Getintopc.com_DS.SolidWorks.2021.SP0.0.Premium_4\DS.SolidWorks.2021.SP0.0.Premium\_SolidSQUAD_\_SolidSQUAD_\Program Files
copy contents of it to the C: directory 
as shown in the READ ME file downloaded with your solidworks setup
(hope if you can solve my bug u send it to me trying to learn here!)
